          <div class="question">
            What is the difference between let, const, and var in JavaScript?
          </div>
          <p class="answer">
            var is function-scoped and can be redeclared; it is hoisted. let is
            block-scoped and cannot be redeclared in the same scope. const is
            block-scoped and must be initialized; its value cannot be
            reassigned.

            What is the purpose of a DNS (Domain Name System)?
          </div>
          <p class="answer">
            DNS translates human-readable domain names (like example.com) into
            IP addresses, allowing computers to locate servers on the internet.

          <div class="question">
            Explain the difference between == and === in JavaScript.
          </div>
          <p class="answer">
            == compares values after type coercion. === compares both value and
            type without coercion.

          <div class="question">What is a REST API and why is it used?</div>
          <p class="answer">
            A REST API (Representational State Transfer) is an architecture for
            building web services. It uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
            to interact with resources. It's used because it is stateless,
            scalable, and easy to integrate with web applications.
